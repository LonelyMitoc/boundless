## Description
This is a website where writers can come together to collaborate on a series of short stories. The homepage will display all published stories from the collaboration. Authors can login to their profile to create new stories to start the collaboration or add onto existing stories by selecting the appropriate tab.

On the front-end, the handlebar syntax gave us a few issues but we were able to get through with minor help. We had the most difficulty with establishing a Many-to-Many association with our tables as well as remembering to call both One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationship in the api calling.

The future development of this website is to be able to report malicious stories and ban users, increase the word count for the stories, voting for the stories and having different sections on the homepage to show top voted and most recently published stories, addition of images that would be related to the story, being able to edit your section of the stories (this may not be implemented because this could change the story completely and unconnected to the other user's contributions).
